    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into chunks</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>10 slices fresh ginger</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
        <li>½ cup dry sherry</li>
        <li>⅓ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup fresh Thai basil leaves</li>
        <li>3 dried whole red chilies</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat vegetable oil in a <em>large skillet over medium-high heat</em>. Add chicken and cook until 
            <strong><em>lightly browned on all sides</em></strong>, about 5 minutes. Remove chicken 
            from the skillet and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat sesame oil in the same skillet. Add ginger and garlic; <em>cook and stir until ginger 
            begins to brown, about 30 seconds</em>. Stir in reserved chicken, sherry, soy sauce, water, 
            and sugar. Bring to a boil, then <strong>reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until there is only 
            1/4 cup of liquid left in the skillet, about 20 minutes</strong>. Stir in basil and chiles; 
            increase heat to medium and continue cooking until liquid is almost gone.
