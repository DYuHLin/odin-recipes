            Spread cabbage and cilantro over a <strong>clean dish towel</strong>. Gather up towel 
            and squeeze out as much moisture from the cabbage as possible.
        </li>

        <li>
            Transfer cabbage and cilantro to a bowl. Add pork, egg whites, jalapeno 
            peppers, ginger, and sesame oil. <em>Mix thoroughly with your hands. Season 
            with salt and pepper</em>.
        </li>

        <li>
            Cover 2 baking sheets with <em>waxed paper</em>. Fill a small bowl with water.
        </li>

        <li>
            Hold a potsticker wrapper in the palm of your hand. Place a tablespoonful 
            of the pork mixture in the center. <strong><em>Dip a finger in water and use it to wet 
            the edges of the wrapper</em></strong>. Fold up edges and pinch together to seal. Transfer 
            dumpling to a prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining wrappers and pork mixture.
