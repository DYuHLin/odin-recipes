    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is a versatile recipe: you can vary the tea and milk you use and sweeten it to taste. 
        Brew tea to your preferred strength, though it's a good idea to use strong tea 
        because you're going to dilute it with milk and ice. You'll need a <strong>wide straw</strong> to drink 
        the boba, or use a long spoon for fishing them out.
