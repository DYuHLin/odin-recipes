# odin-recipes
This is my first Odin Project where I will be creating a website for recipes with the basics of Html
that I have learnt in thus far in the foundation course. I will demonstrate things such as how to 
write the boilerplate, write a paragraph and headings in Html, inserting images and links, making lists, making things bold and italics etc.
